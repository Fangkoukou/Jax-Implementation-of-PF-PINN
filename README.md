## Project Structure

This rewritten version is modularized into the following components:

### `params`
- A global configuration module storing all the parameters used by the differential equations
  
### `utils`
- Contains helper functions used for:
  - PDE residual calculation
  - Initial and boundary condition evaluation

### `variable`
- A wrapper class built on `SimpleNamespace`
- Facilitates organized access to training samples splited as:
  - Initial conditions (IC)
  - Boundary conditions (BC)
  - Collocation points
  - Adaptive sampling points

### `sampler`
- Handles sampling logic for training:

### `residual`
- Responsible for residual, loss, loss weight computations:
  - Utilizes automatic differentiation in JAX for accurate gradients 
  - Computes the residual for initial condition, boundary condition and PDE residuals
  - Computes also the NTK weights

### `train`
- the training file:
  - contains model definition and training loop

## Features

- Built using **JAX** for high-performance automatic differentiation and GPU acceleration.
- Modular and extendable design, modify residual class for different 1D differential equations.
- Supports adaptive sampling and residual-based training.
