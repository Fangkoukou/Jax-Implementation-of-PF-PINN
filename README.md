## Project Structure

This rewritten version is modularized into the following components:

### `params`
- A global configuration module storing all the parameters
  
### `derivative`
- A set of derivative functions implemented using JAX automatic differentiation

### `pde`
- A PDE module that contains PDE parameters and a set of helper functions in residual computation

### `residual`
- Responsible for residual, loss, loss weight computations, depends on `derivative` and `pde`
- 
### `sampler`
- Handles sampling logic for training, depends on `residual`

### `train`
- the training file:
  - contains model definition and training loop

## Features

- Built using **JAX** for high-performance automatic differentiation and GPU acceleration.
- Modular and extendable design, modify residual class for different 1D differential equations.
- Supports adaptive sampling and residual-based training.
